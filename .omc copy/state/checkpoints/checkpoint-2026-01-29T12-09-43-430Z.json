COnsider the ramifications of such a retooling and identify potential risks and errors which need to be handled.\n\nDevelop a granular implementation plan for the mono-repo version of this application including planning, building, validating, CI tests, code review checkpoints and quality gates, documentation and deployment (in a docker rootless environment, with a tight range of external ports exposed between 5810 and 5850).\n\nCommit atomically."
